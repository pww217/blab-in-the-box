Twilight's hue paints the sky,
As stars begin to wink their eye.
The moon, a silver orb, ascends,
And night's embrace envelopes us. ğŸŒ™

In slumber's arms, we lay our head,
Dreams dance and play instead.
A symphony of crickets sing,
As owls take flight on silent wing. ğŸ¦‰

The world around us rests in peace,
While nature sings her lullabies.
In stillness, we find our bliss,
And sleep's sweet arms enfold us tight. ğŸŒ²
